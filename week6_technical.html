          <p>Class methods are methods that can only be called on a class. They are different from instance methods in that instance methods are called on an instance of a class. Compositionally they are very close as both are created inside a class. However class methods start with <em>self</em> and then the method name. Take a look at the picture below.

          Instance methods do not need the self when defining the method name. Take a look below.

          <p>This is interesting, since <a href ="http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2011/07/are-class-methods-evil/">some people</a> do not particularly like class methods, they think of them as relics of the past. While others see class methods as a way to store application configurations, such as how many instances of a particular class have been created. Check out the RubyMonk resource for more information.
