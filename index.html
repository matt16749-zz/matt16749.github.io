          <p>Someone once told me that finding the right person for a job is like dating. You need to have chemistry to make sure you have the right fit. You want this person to be a responsive, who can appreciate your ideas, who can be closeby but not too clingy. Hopefully, someone who can also make you laugh. Take a look around. See if you like what you see. And if so, go ahead and contact me.</p>

        <p class="caption">About Me</p>
          <p class="body">It's a funny thing really, how I got involved in programming. I guess you could call it a quarter life crisis.<p>
            <p></p>
          <p class="body">In a past life I was a budding biology teacher invested in solving the problem of socioeconomic disparity in our country. You see, I had read Freire's "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" my first year in college and I was inspired to do something that would impact the world. I taught in inner-city schools, tutored those who couldn't afford a summer education, mentored students on how to pursue higher education. I went to meetings to study the latest techniques. I met with Oakland politician Noel Gallo. I didn't see teaching as a job, but rather a higher calling. So when I was invited to be a founder of a school in Oakland, I jumped at the chance. "What a great opportunity!" I thought. "I will be able to impact so many lives!" However my elation lasted just for a short while. I quickly found out what being a founder entailed, and the politics behind education. For a while I could put up with it, but the constant bickering threatened my morality. Eventually I decided to step aside from teaching as I could no longer educate with a clear conscience.</p>
            <p></p>
          <p class="body">I went on a sabbatical to meditate my next steps. What shall I do with my life? Should I go into private education? Perhaps look towards graduate school? Maybe try to teach in Japan? As I pondered what do I came upon Ruby and subsequently, Rails while I browsed the net. I found the material to be a rehash of all I've learned about education; where I once was teaching students the steps in the scientific method I now am teaching a computer how to solve a problem.</p>
            <p></p>
          <p class="body">There is a pedagogy in education called the responsive approach. In it, a teacher takes his students' social and emotional growth into account as he educates. He leaves nothing to chance, explicitly teaching emotional intelligence to his charges. It's very similar to the way I approach my new career, by leaving nothing to chance. This is a responsive website. And I will pursue my new passion, building one website at a time.</p>
