    <h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>
    <p>War, huh yeah. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing, oh hoh, oh.</p>

    <p>There were a few times during my teaching career that I had an emotional conflict with someone. Usually they were with my professors and mentors about students, pedagogy, or how we should approach urban education. The ones about students were the most emotional as high school students can always be a handfull. I didn't realize the amount of pressure that teachers face everyday until I was put into a similar situation and had to make snap judgments on character, thought processes, and student drama. As an educator, I tried to create an isolated, safe community within my classroom so that students don't have to worry about factors outside of education, but there really is no way to remove all the baggage students bring in. You just need to make the best of the situation. It's a learning process, as all things are.</p>
