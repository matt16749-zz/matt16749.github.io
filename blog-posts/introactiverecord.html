            <h1>Active Record</h1>
            <p>Today was the first time we worked with a framework. It wasn't quite Sinatra and definitely wasn't Rails, but it was tough for many of us who haven't seen Active Record nonetheless. We were able to go through Ruby with </p>

            <h1>ORM</h1>
            <img src="./images/orm.png">
            <p>ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping, a technique for converting data between two systems. In our context, we are converting tables in an RDBMS(SQLite) to classes in Ruby. The image above gives a concise representation of what we learned, but here's the rundown for people who like to read.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Naming Conventions:Database Tables are plural while Ruby models are singular. Both are CamelCase. </li>
                    <li>Tables of a database are mapped to a class in Ruby</li>
                    <li>Rows of database table are mapped to an instance of a class in Ruby.</li>
                    <li>Columns(headers) of database table are attributes of the Ruby class.</li>

            <h1>Overview of Active Record Workflow</h1>
            <p>Active Record is one example of ORM. In our context, it manages the back-end of our application and links the database tables to models.</p>
            <img src="./images/activerecordworkflow.png">
            <p>We were able to have a coach come in the afternoon to talk about an Active Record workflow as we design the back-end of an application. This is what she said.</p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Create your database</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design your schema(On a whiteboard or SQL Designer...etc)</li>
                    <li>Plan out a table via Rails migrations based on schema</li>
                    <li>Create your database. In your rake file you should have commands(rake db:create makes the database file)</li>
                    <li>Migrate your table schema into your actual database(rake db:migrate from step 2)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Set up models to coincide with your database via Active Record Associations</li>
                <li>Write your program</li>
              </ol>

                    <p>Where all the gems that are required for the application are stored. When you run bundle, the gems in this file are all installed locally so that you can use the application.</p>

                    <p>A series of commands that you have created that work upon your entire application directory.</p>

                            <p>Makes the table and schema according to your migrate files.</p>
