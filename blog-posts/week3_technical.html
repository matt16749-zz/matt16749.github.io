        <div class="body">
            <p>The main reason why Javascript is so popular is because it allows you use do things in the browswer without sending messages back and forth to the server.</p>
            <p>Usually, a client type in a URL. This URL is like an address for a webpage. A web server will take the client's request and send back the requested webpage. But Javascript allows you to circumvent that.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Lets take a look at what Javascript can do. I have a stuffed animal named Bob. I want to send Bob on a vacation to Japan, so I type in <a href="http://unagi-travel.net">Unagi Travel</a> into my web browser. At Unagi Travel, there is an inquiry form so I can inquire my stuffed animal Bob's itinerary. Now if JavaScript was running on this form, I could be notified of a typo I made in my request to see Tokyo before I submit my form. However, because JavaScript is not running, I wouldn't catch this typo.</p>
