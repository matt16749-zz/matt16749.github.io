    <p>For this blog challenge, I was required to choose one value that I had during my happiest/proudest/most satisfied moment.</p> 

    <p>I chose accomplishment. My proudest moment was when I was nominated by the senior class at American Indian Public High School as the Teacher of the Year. I was given the opportunity to speak at the commencement ceremony and met with some Oakland officials. But most importantly, I was able to see <em>each</em> of my seniors be accepted into a college.</p>

    <p>From a scale of 1-5, I'm a 5 as I try to live out this value.</p>
    
    <p>I feel proud when I think of my values. I try to stand by them whenever I can, as they are what shaped my character. I do think that it can help me mediate stereotype threat as I don't really focus on the stereotypes, but rather on the extent of my abilities</p>
