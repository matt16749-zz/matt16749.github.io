            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>We were given an assignment today that required us to build a very basic racing game. The idea was that a user would set a number of racers which would then race against each other. The entire process after a user inputs the number of racers would be automated. We were given a skeleton of code to work around, and the very first thing I noticed was that I had two classes, the game itself and a Die class which would randomly generate the distance each racer would take per turn. And here was my problem. How do I get methods from one class to talk to another class?(Aka sending messages between classes?)</p>
            
            <h1>A Traditional Call</h1>
            <p>Up to this point in my developer life, I've dealt with method calls in one class by creating an instance of the class and then calling the method as so.</p>

            <h1>Sending Messages</h1>
            <p>What I didn't realize was that not only can you create an instance of a class within a different class, but also you can method chain onto these class instances like so.</p>

            <p>After coming to this realization the problem became much more manageable.</p>
