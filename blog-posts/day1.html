            <h1>$("DBC").ready(function(start){})</h1>
            <p>I had my first day at DevBootCamp today, and it was eye-opening. Let's start at the beginning. When we first came to the DBC campus, we were welcomed by students in cohorts that had started earlier this year. (At any time there are three different cohorts at DBC with varying degrees of advancement) We did some icebreakers and went over the culture at DBC (Integrity, Kindness, and Effort) and established our first support groups. Then we were introduced to our Phase 1 Week 1 Ruby challenges.</p>
            <p>I thought that I would be ready for any challenge thrown at me but after my first pairing session I realized my naivety. Though I've done the challenges before, I haven't been very D.R.Y with my code. Through pairing today I've realized I need to review modulus(%) and refactoring using loops.</p>
            <p>But so far, the DBC experience seems to definitely be worth it. I will try to keep blogging once per day, but most of the blogs will probably be technical in nature.</p>

            <h1>Git Cloning</h1>
            <p>Git cloning is a way of copying a remote repository from Github onto a local repository on your computer. The Git workflow that we use at DBC is as follows:</p>
            <p>(Commands are written in the Command Line):</p>
            <p>git clone https://github.com/(remoterepository)</p>
            <p>git checkout -b your_name-partner_name (Creates a branch off master in your local repository)</p>
            <p>git add filename</p>
            <p>git commit -m 'message about commit'</p>
            <p>git push origin your_name-partner_name (you will push your local branch onto github. Origin refers to the master branch off Github, so essentially this command allows you to 'branch' off on the remote master branch)</p>
            <p>To clone a remote branch off github, use the following command in the command line:</p>
            <p>git clone -b (branchname) (remote repository URL)</p>
