            <h1>$("DBC").ready(function(start){})</h1>
            <p>I had my first day at DevBootCamp today, and it was eye-opening. Let's start at the beginning. When we first came to the DBC campus, we were welcomed by students in cohorts that had started earlier this year. (At any time there are three different cohorts at DBC with varying degrees of advancement) We did some icebreakers and went over the culture at DBC (Integrity, Kindness, and Effort) and established our first support groups. Then we were introduced to our Phase 1 Week 1 Ruby challenges.</p>
            <p>I thought that I would be ready for any challenge thrown at me but after my first pairing session I realized my naivety. Though I've done the challenges before, I haven't been very D.R.Y with my code. Through pairing today I've realized I need to review modulus(%) and refactoring using loops.</p>
            <p>But so far, the DBC experience seems to definitely be worth it. I will try to keep blogging once per day, but most of the blogs will probably be technical in nature.</p>
