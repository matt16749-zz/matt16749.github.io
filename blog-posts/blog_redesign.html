<div class="titlename">Blog Redesign</div>

<section>
  <article>
    <h1>A New Look</h1>
    <p>It has been less than two months since I started working on programming challenges from DevBootCamp, and yet I feel like I've already come a long way. This blog's graphical design was influenced by <a href="http://cerinman.github.io">Tommy Dugger's blog</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>
    
    <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>When I first started remaking my blog, I wanted something that would be responsive, eye-catching, fun, and San Francisco-y(Made up a word. Hah.) to pay homage to DevBootCamp's primary location. Having been a fan of 8-bit and 16-bit games, I thought it would be cool to give my site a retro-like feel. The first thing I needed to create this feel was an illustrator for my background, so I went and contacted James off one of my favorite websites: Fiverr. James has been an illustrator for 5+ years and gives very reasonable prices. You can check out his work <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/james_illus">here</a>.</p>
    <p>After receiving the illustration for the background, I proceeded to tweak my wireframes to work for mobile and desktop readability. I decided to place my navbar on the leftmost side of my blog for easy access on wider desktop widths and mobile-widescreen. After that, it was a matter of searching for webfonts and colors that would complement my retro look.</p>

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <p>After my initial redesign, I decided to send the blog to Tommy for feedback. He was kind enough to recommend removing an introduction from my landing page as it caused a cramped feel. He also pointed out small things such as centering my nav icons vs. having them oriented left. He did suggest to offset my blog-posts gray wrapper from being parallel to the bottom of my site, but after experimenting with an empty footer and comparing the layout, I preferred my style more.</p>

    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
    <p>Though I'm very satisfied with the look of my website, I do want to do add some more things. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">As of this posting I have not yet added any JQuery scripts, so the first thing that I will do is to create some clouds to float around in the sky.</span> (Edit: I have added my clouds!) I also took a look at <a href="http://spritely.net">Spritely</a> and might use it to animate King-Kong climbing the left side of my gray wrapper. Sort of a tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampage_(video_game)">Rampage</a>. But that's a larger project for the future when I have more time.</p>
