              <h4>What's my take on the DBC experience?</h4>
              <p>Not to sound cliche, but DBC is very much like 'What you put in is what you get out.' In my past profession I had to go through a test made up of ideology, pedagogy, and actual practice with reflection in order to get a state teaching license. It was very frustrating at times, but what got me through the process was my cohort. We were able to answer each other's questions, examine each others teaching in person and taped. So when Shareef mentions how DBC was like in the very beginning, I become excited. I want to have that sort of education, where I am not just receiving something because I paid for it (the restaurant mindset), but rather am receiving an experience because I am putting my effort into it.</p>
            <h4>What's my impression of DBC?</h4>
              <p>DBC is very much like the teaching profession in that it is collaborative (in creating lesson plans), and at the same time individualistic. No one is going to hold your hand through the lessons, but there is group work as well as 'Unit tests'. I believe that DBC can be summed up in one word: accountablity.</p>
            <h4>How do I see myself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
              <p>I'm excited. I love to work in groups, to be part of a culture of learning. I've been in one since Cal and my past profession, and this seems like the most natural progression in my career.</p>
            <h4>Has my expectations of DBC changed?</h4>
              <p>It has. To be honest, I did have a restraunt mindset before watching the Fireside Chat, but after watching it I feel like it's exceeded my expectations. Shereef has definitely researched the teaching aspect of a coding bootcamp, and I'm very impressed that he's read through "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" by Paulo Freire.This actually was the very first book I read in college. To hear him articulate the intricate problems with public education and in listening to how he has set up DBC with its accountability structure, I've become even more excited to join DBC.</p>
