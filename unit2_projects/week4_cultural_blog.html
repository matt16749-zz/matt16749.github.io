          <p class="caption">What Is It?</p>
            <div class="body">
              <p>Net Neutrality is the principle of treating all data on the internet equally, not discriminating against one or another based on user, application, software, hardware, or anything else.</p>

          <p class="caption">The Problem</p>
            <div class="body">
              <p>The current controversy regarding net neutrality in the United States is that the FCC(Federal Communication Commission) wants to allow internet service providers such as Verizon to differentiate the connection speeds of websites and applications by how much their client is willing to pay. Opponents of this proposal argue that by doing so, the FCC is putting a handicap on tech innovation since  startups with little capital wouldn't be able to compete against larger, richer corporations. </p>

          <p class="caption">A Solution?</p>  
            <div class="body">
              <p>There are no quick solutions to this problem. Opponents of the proposal are right in that this breaking of net neutrality would handicap innovation for startups that depend on web applications. If we were to look at what other countries are doing, the Asian countries have upheld net neutrality(with the exception of China and Democratic People's Republic of Korea). South America has several countries that have laws expressly upholding net neutrality. As of this posting, the EU has passed a <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2014/04/03/european-parliament-passes-strong-net-neutrality-law-along-with-major-roaming-reforms/">very strong net neutrality law</a>.</p>
              <p>I tend to agree with opponents of the upcoming US proposal. By ending net neutrality in the United States, the FCC will be handicapping innovation. That would be a step backwards for everyone involved.</p>
